#Fishtank controller :tropical_fish:

## Description

More description should come here


This application is a remote fishtank controller. It was developed on a raspberry pi b+ using WEbio framework which is a great approach to the internet of things. 

## To Do

* Auto/manual buttons .
* Txt with configuration parameters.
* Test sensor
* Finish wiki
* Release project V0 Index.html 
* Go Live in Pi hooked to the fishtank and weaved

## In Process
* formating colors and text 
* Tide up code and document macros
* Test waved with the live system.

### Comments-Hot
Changes can be done offline.

### Past Comments-Cold
read gpio status to html text  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/webiopi/macro$20LightStatus/webiopi/ho7N8AoOeWo/xULL5L0xZO0J


##Done
* Implement state indicators
* Html layout 
* Edit buttons and reformat	  
* Implementation two bottons routine in all outputs 
* Links to configuration and statistics webpages.
* Status bar.
* Two buttons controlling same output.
* Button On/Off one macro for each output(Not a good practice though) 
* Github subversion
* Implementation on/off indicators
* Save image back up out of the two systems(live one and development projects), can be found in GitHub as Fishtank_live and Fishtank
* Development board connected to waved. 
* Documentation of the hardware and bring telling the story back to the md.


## NICE TO HAVE
*One macro that reads two independent buttons and controls one output. The output number should be pass a a part of the macro parameters. This will allow to use only one macro for the four outputs.

#Telling the story
The following steps summarise the process of setting up the raspberry pi for the develpment of the fishtank project

##1 Setting up Rasp pi from scratch

I don’t really have spare screens keyboards and mice kicking around my place, so that I had to learn how to  communicate with the Raspberry Pi(Here after “Pi”) using ssh. this mode of use is called “Raspberry headless"

	https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=74176
	sudo apt-get update 
	sudo apt-get upgrade 
	sudo apt-get auto remove

The first thing to do is to find the IP address of the PI, to do so, connect to the internet accespoint at home, go to find who is connected to the dh

then open a terminal in mac press ⌘+space, 
then type in the terminal 
	ssh pi@192.168.1.3
then enter your password, usually is raspberry 
	

Voila!!!, you are now in the command prompt of the raspberry pi. from here everything should be easier, if you know what I mean …
For more information have a look here:



##2 Making the Pi environment confortable to play with:
File sharing AFP
with this application you can open the directories of the PI as they were “Living” local in your mac. To do so it is needed to install the Netatalk first in the Raspberry pi. enter the following command in the shell
sudo apt-get install netatalk
		
Installing a good  script editor
Install Sublime text if using MAC
