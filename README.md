## Description

This application is a remote fishtank controller. It was developed on a raspberry pi b+ using WEbio framework which is a great approach to the internet of things. 

## Nice To Have



## To Do
* DONE Html layout 
* DONE Edit buttons and reformat	  
* DONE Implementation two bottons routine in all outputs 
* Implement state indicators example in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/webiopi/macro$20LightStatus/webiopi/ho7N8AoOeWo/xULL5L0xZO0J
* Save image back up out of the two systems(live one and development projects)
* auto/manual buttons
* Try writing to a txt
* Try sensor
* waved
* Release project V0 Index.html work properlyand release
* Go Live in Pi hooked to the fishtank


## In Process

*Implementation on/off indicators
### Comments


## NICE TO HAVE
*github subversion								DONE
*Two buttons on/off working properly, still to change the macro to make it work as only one function, instead of individual specific macros.

#Telling the story

1 Setting up Rasp pi from scratch

I don’t really have spare screens keyboards and mice kicking around my place, so that I had to learn how to  communicate with the Raspberry Pi(Here after “Pi”) using ssh. this mode of use is called “Raspberry headless"

https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=74176


sudo apt-get update 
sudo apt-get upgrade 
sudo apt-get auto remove


The first thing to do is to find the IP address of the PI, to do so, connect to the internet accespoint at home, go to find who is connected to the dh

then open a terminal in mac press ⌘+space, 
then type in the terminal 
	ssh pi@192.168.1.3
then enter your password, usually is raspberry 
	

Voila!!!, you are now in the command prompt of the raspberry pi. from here everything should be easier, if you know what I mean …
For more information have a look here:



2 Making the Pi environment confortable to play with:
File sharing AFP
with this application you can open the directories of the PI as they were “Living” local in your mac. To do so it is needed to install the Netatalk first in the Raspberry pi. enter the following command in the shell
sudo apt-get install netatalk
		
Installing a good  script editor
Install Sublime text if using MAC
