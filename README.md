#Fishtank controller :tropical_fish:

## Description

This project started out me being lazy to toggle the light switch on and off. Then I asked myself: What if I control it from my mobile phone? and why not make it automatic?. Fortunately I had a Raspberry Pi gathering dust on my desk. When I started I thought it was a weekend project, but being here writing the "ReadMe" of my fishtank controller probes I did underestimate the project, it has been a lot of fun. Now getting ready to go live with version 2, which will have an Arduino to deal with a pressure sensor to monitor the CO2 reactor(a rather messy experiment), Temperature sensor and maybe a couple LED strips to dim the light in at night.

The following "ReadMe" is basically development process the logbook of the development process. This guide is divided into the development notes, todo lists, tasks done, nice to have and command cheat sheet stuff that is helpful to have handy in the development process. Towards the end, there is draft version of the installation\rebuilding Wiki, which describes how to build the project again, just in case the system goes bang or refuses to work.

Now then Let's start over again properly!!!!

My name is Juan, I have a fishtank which I control using my mobile phone. The main controller is a Raspberry Pi model B. That single computer board is connected to a driver board which handles the power side of the system.
The raspberry Pi is the bridge between the mobile-friendly web application and the fishtank. The development at the moment allows to activate lights, water filter and the air pump. In the future it is intended to go for more elements such as, temperature sensor, Co2 dispenser, LEd lights and PH sensor.
FYI my mail is juanpadillavivas@gmail.com if you want more information I am more than happy to share the experiences.


## ToDo 
* Auto/Manual buttons .
* Txt with configuration parameters/ Might change to read mysql DB
* Tidy up ReadMe, grammar and typos. 
* Go Live in Pi hooked to the fishtank and weaved
* Implement gauges
* Connectivity with arduino serial using USB Port(will save Arduino power connection, also will ask current from pi, migh not be a good apporach)

## In Process
* Test waved with the live system.
* Pi-stop lights


### Comments-Hot
Images under buttons [link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/webiopi/URkwd1O42YI)


### Past Comments-Cold
read gpio status to html text  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/webiopi/macro$20LightStatus/webiopi/ho7N8AoOeWo/xULL5L0xZO0J
Changes can be done offline.


##Done
* Verify database connectivity.
* Change the outputs and Go life Beta version. pins 23,24,25 , temperature sensor addes
* Tidy Up application
* formating colors and text 
* Tide up code and document macros
* Test sensor
* Implement state indicators
* Html layout 
* Edit buttons and reformat	  
* Implementation two bottons routine in all outputs 
* Links to configuration and statistics webpages.
* Status bar.
* Two buttons controlling same output.
* Button On/Off one macro for each output(Not a good practice though) 
* Github subversion
* Implementation on/off indicators
* Save image back up out of the two systems(live one and development projects), can be found in GitHub as Fishtank_live and 
Fishtank
* Development board connected to waved. 
* Documentation of the hardware and bring telling the story back to the md.


## NICE TO HAVE
*One macro that reads two independent buttons and controls one output. The output number should be pass a a part of the macro parameters. This will allow to use only one macro for the four outputs.

#Telling the story
The following steps summarise the process of setting up the raspberry pi for the development of the Fish tank project

##1 Setting up Rasp pi from scratch

I don’t really have spare screens keyboards and mice kicking around my place, so that I had to learn how to communicate with the Raspberry Pi(Here after “Pi”) using SSH. This mode of use is called “Raspberry headless"

The first thing to do is to find the IP address of the PI, to do so, connect to the internet access point at home(Router), go to find who is connected to it. Then open a terminal in mac press ⌘+space, then type in the terminal
	```
	ssh pi@192.168.1.7
	```
Then enter your password, usually is raspberry 


![Pi SSh console](https://github.com/FreeRangeLobster/Fishtank_Development/blob/master/ScreenGrabs%20and%20Pics/SmallSize/Pi%20SSh%20Small.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Voila!!!, You are now in the command prompt of the raspberry pi. From here everything should be easier, if you know what I mean.. It is recommendable to update the SW of the Pi the first time is connected. I am assuming an internet connection is available.
	```
	sudo apt-get update 
	sudo apt-get upgrade 
	sudo apt-get autoremove
	```
For more information go to: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=74176

##2 Making the Pi environment confortable to play with:
The following applications will make the linux enviroment easier to edit, test and run applications.
###File sharing AFP 
This application allows to open the directories of the PI as they were “Living” local in your mac. To do so, it is needed to install the Netatalk first in the Raspberry pi. enter the following command in the shell
	sudo apt-get install netatalk
Having installed the netatalk in the Pi, you need to access the RasperryPi, to do so press ⌘ + k

Pi directory

###Installing a script editor

After having installed the Nettalk, you can access files in the pi and edit them locally as if it was in your own computer. That is just brilliant!! and really handy. Now you need a good text editor, my weapon of choice is: 
"Sublime is a cross-platform text and source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, Sublime Text is proprietary software; all license revenue accrues to the developer." wikipedia
If you have the means, Please buy it and support the team. It is a really good application. It can be used as a trial for a while.


Sublime

##3 Installing webIO

WEbIO Pi is a really good approach to the internet of things, This framework allows to control, debug and use the RaspberryPI GPIO from any webpage. Moreover, it is equipped with a set of sensor/actuator libraries and plugins that facilitates the communication with standard sensors.

WEBIO framework

#pi semaphore GPIO positions

Item | Description| Reference | Link |Position|Pin|Colour
---------|----------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
Close to the border|GPIO7|Red
	|GPIO8|Amber
	|GPIO25|Green
Other side:
	|GPIO10|Red
	|GPIO9|Amber
	|GPIO11| Green

#Temperature one wire support
get into the configuration folder to add the sensor in the boot 
	
	
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
 in the last line  add 
```
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```
reboot the pi

```
sudo reboot
```
find the serial of the sensor by typing in the terminal
```
sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
ls
```

Copy the serial of the sensor that starts with
 
```
28-xxxx  
```

Enter to the configuration of the web server using the following command
```
sudo nano /etc/webiopi/config
```

As always before making any changes save a backup and comment changes in the code. In the device section add the following line of code 

```

...

#temp0 = TMP102
#temp1 = TMP102 slave:0x49
#temp2 = DS18B20
#temp3 = DS18B20 slave:28-0000049bc218

#=============Add this sensor ID ======================
tmp0 = DS18B20 slave:28-04146de39cff
#======================================================

#bmp = BMP085
28-xxxx  
```



then save and reestart the servergo to the webpage and it should show the temperature.

#setup wifi
```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Compare the contents of the file, if it exists, to the following code. If the file is empty, you can use this code to populate it. Take note of the commented lines (indicated by the # marks) to reference which variable you should use based on your current Wi-Fi node configuration.

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
ssid="YOURSSID"
psk="YOURPASSWORD" 

# Protocol type can be: RSN (for WP2) and WPA (for WPA1)
proto=WPA

# Key management type can be: WPA-PSK or WPA-EAP (Pre-Shared or Enterprise)
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

# Pairwise can be CCMP or TKIP (for WPA2 or WPA1)
pairwise=TKIP

#Authorization option should be OPEN for both WPA1/WPA2 (in less commonly used are SHARED and LEAP)
auth_alg=OPEN
}
```

When you’re done editing the file, press CTRL+X to save and exit the document. Now is the time to unplug the Ethernet cable and plug in the Wi-Fi dongle.

At the command prompt, enter the following command:

```
sudo reboot
```




#Set static ip 
The system will be operated using a mobile, it will be way too difficult to scan the whole network searching for the address that has the application. Therefore, It is an "Deadly important to have" a stati address. In this case the application I use 192.168.1.19. The following command allows to enter to the register:


```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

As always, when it comes to modify a register, it is a good practice to take a back up of the configuration. just in case

BackUp wireless configuration
	```
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	auto eth0
	
	allow-hotplug eth0
	iface eth0 inet manual
	
	auto wlan0
	allow-hotplug wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet manual
	
	wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	
	auto wlan1
	allow-hotplug wlan1
	iface wlan1 inet manual
	wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 
	```

New configuration including the static IP address
	```
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	iface eth0 inet dhcp
	
	allow-hotplug wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.19
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.1.1
	wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	iface default inet dhcp
	```
Reference [Link](http://weworkweplay.com/play/automatically-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-wifi-network/)

After rebooting the system, and attempting to ssh the pi 
```
ssh pi@192.168.1.19
```

If the same address has been used to connect other Pies, the terminal might prompt something like this:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
d4:ae:02:2c:bb:97:b0:38:3f:c1:cd:a8:58:68:d7:55.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/Juan/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /Users/Juan/.ssh/known_hosts:8
RSA host key for 192.168.1.19 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
```

To solve this issue type:
```
ssh-keygen -R <host>
```
For my case
```
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.19
```
