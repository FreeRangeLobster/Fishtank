#Fishtank controller :tropical_fish:

## Description

My name is Juan and I have a 120liter fish tank. I am, however, also an engineer, the lazy type. Fish tanks require quite a lot of work, which includes air pumps, lights, heating and water filtering. As an engineer, I have asked myself: how could I make the fish tank control easier? This is how I got to the idea of an automated fish tank control, which can be operated remotely via a mobile phone app. 

This project uses a Raspberry Pi model B as a main controller. The raspberry Pi is the bridge between the mobile-friendly web application and the fish tank. The development at the moment allows to activate lights, water filter and the air pump. Version 2 of the project allows to control more elements, such as temperature sensor, a Co2 dispenser, LED lights and a pH sensor. 

The following "ReadMe" is the logbook of the development process. This guide is divided into the development notes, todo lists, tasks done, nice to have and command cheat sheet stuff, and helpful notes to have handy in the development process. Towards the end, there is draft version of the installation\rebuilding Wiki, which describes how to rebuild the project again, just in case the system crashes or refuses to work.

If you would like more information regarding my project, feel free to contact me on juanpadillavivas@gmail.com. I would be more than happy to share my experiences with you!

### Comments-Hot
Images under buttons [link](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/webiopi/URkwd1O42YI), waiting for new realise of webiopi server.


### Past Comments-Cold
read gpio status to html text  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/webiopi/macro$20LightStatus/webiopi/ho7N8AoOeWo/xULL5L0xZO0J
Changes can be done offline.



## NICE TO HAVE
*One macro that reads two independent buttons and controls one output. The output number should be pass a a part of the macro parameters. This will allow to use only one macro for the four outputs.

#Telling the story
The following steps summarise the process of setting up the raspberry pi for the development of the Fish tank project

##1 Setting up Rasp pi from scratch

I don’t really have spare screens keyboards and mice kicking around my place, therefore I had to learn how to communicate with the Raspberry Pi(Here after “Pi”) using SSH. This is called “Raspberry headless"
The first thing to do is to find the IP address of the PI. To do so, connect to the internet access point at home(Router) and find who is connected to it. Then open a terminal: in Mac this is done by pressing ⌘+space and then type “terminal” and press Enter.  When in the terminal, type ssh pi@192.168.1.7 (use your own ip address, this is an example that worked in my case). Finally, enter your password, which is usually raspberry

	```
	ssh pi@192.168.1.7
	```
Then enter your password, usually is raspberry 


![Pi SSh console](https://github.com/FreeRangeLobster/Fishtank_Development/blob/master/ScreenGrabs%20and%20Pics/SmallSize/Pi%20SSh%20Small.png "Logo Title Text 1")

Voila!!!, You are now in the command prompt of the Pi. From here everything should be easier, if you know what I mean.. It is recommendable to update the  Pi software the first time it is connected (I am assuming an internet connection is available).  
	
	```
	sudo apt-get update 
	sudo apt-get upgrade 
	sudo apt-get autoremove
	```
	
For more information go to: https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&t=74176

##2 Making the Pi environment confortable to play with:
The following applications will make the linux enviroment easier to edit, test and run applications.
###File sharing AFP 
This application allows to open the directories of the PI as they were “Living” local in your mac. To do so, it is necessary first to install the Netatalk in the Pi.. To do so, enter the following command in the shell 
	```
	sudo apt-get install netatalk
	```

Having installed the netatalk in the Pi, you need to access the RasperryPi, to do so press ⌘ + k

Connection

Pi directory

###Installing a script editor

Once Netatalk has been installed, you can access files that are in the Pi and edit them locally as if they were on your own computer. That is just brilliant (and also really handy)! Now you need a good text editor. My weapon of choice is Sublime. According to Wikipedia, "Sublime is a cross-platform text and source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, Sublime Text is proprietary software; all license revenue accrues to the developer." If you have the means, please buy it and support the team. It is a really good application. It can be used as a trial for a while.

##3 Installing webIO

WEbIO Pi is a really good approach to the internet of things. This framework allows to control, debug and use the RaspberryPI GPIO from any webpage. Moreover, it is equipped with a set of sensor/actuator libraries and plugins that facilitates the communication with standard sensors.

WEBIO framework

	|GPIO8|Amber
	|GPIO25|Green
Other side:
	|GPIO10|Red
	|GPIO9|Amber
	|GPIO11| Green

#Temperature one wire support
get into the configuration folder to add the sensor in the boot 
	
	
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
 in the last line  add 
```
dtoverlay=w1-gpio
```
reboot the pi

```
sudo reboot
```
find the serial of the sensor by typing in the terminal
```
sudo modprobe w1-gpio
sudo modprobe w1-therm
cd /sys/bus/w1/devices
ls
```

Copy the serial of the sensor that starts with
 
```
28-xxxx  
```

Enter to the configuration of the web server using the following command
```
sudo nano /etc/webiopi/config
```

As always before making any changes save a backup and comment changes in the code. In the device section add the following line of code 

```

...

#temp0 = TMP102
#temp1 = TMP102 slave:0x49
#temp2 = DS18B20
#temp3 = DS18B20 slave:28-0000049bc218

#=============Add this sensor ID ======================
tmp0 = DS18B20 slave:28-04146de39cff
#======================================================

#bmp = BMP085
28-xxxx  
```



then save and reestart the servergo to the webpage and it should show the temperature.

#setup wifi
```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Compare the contents of the file, if it exists, to the following code. If the file is empty, you can use this code to populate it. Take note of the commented lines (indicated by the # marks) to reference which variable you should use based on your current Wi-Fi node configuration.

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
network={
ssid="YOURSSID"
psk="YOURPASSWORD" 

# Protocol type can be: RSN (for WP2) and WPA (for WPA1)
proto=WPA

# Key management type can be: WPA-PSK or WPA-EAP (Pre-Shared or Enterprise)
key_mgmt=WPA-PSK

# Pairwise can be CCMP or TKIP (for WPA2 or WPA1)
pairwise=TKIP

#Authorization option should be OPEN for both WPA1/WPA2 (in less commonly used are SHARED and LEAP)
auth_alg=OPEN
}
```

When you’re done editing the file, press CTRL+X to save and exit the document. Now is the time to unplug the Ethernet cable and plug in the Wi-Fi dongle.

At the command prompt, enter the following command:

```
sudo reboot
```




#Set static ip 
The system will be operated using a mobile, it will be way too difficult to scan the whole network searching for the address that has the application. Therefore, It is an "Deadly important to have" a stati address. In this case the application I use 192.168.1.19. The following command allows to enter to the register:


```
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
```

As always, when it comes to modify a register, it is a good practice to take a back up of the configuration. just in case

BackUp wireless configuration
	```
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	auto eth0
	
	allow-hotplug eth0
	iface eth0 inet manual
	
	auto wlan0
	allow-hotplug wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet manual
	
	wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	
	auto wlan1
	allow-hotplug wlan1
	iface wlan1 inet manual
	wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf 
	```

New configuration including the static IP address
	```
	auto lo
	iface lo inet loopback
	iface eth0 inet dhcp
	
	allow-hotplug wlan0
	iface wlan0 inet static
	address 192.168.1.19
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	gateway 192.168.1.1
	wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
	iface default inet dhcp
	```
Reference [Link](http://weworkweplay.com/play/automatically-connect-a-raspberry-pi-to-a-wifi-network/)

After rebooting the system, and attempting to ssh the pi 
```
ssh pi@192.168.1.19
```

If the same address has been used to connect other Pies, the terminal might prompt something like this:

```
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that a host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
d4:ae:02:2c:bb:97:b0:38:3f:c1:cd:a8:58:68:d7:55.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /Users/Juan/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending RSA key in /Users/Juan/.ssh/known_hosts:8
RSA host key for 192.168.1.19 has changed and you have requested strict checking.
```

To solve this issue type:
```
ssh-keygen -R <host>
```
For my case
```
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.1.19
```

To set the time
```
sudo date -s "Thu Aug  9 21:31:26 UTC 2012"
```
To see the current time

```
date '+%A %W %Y %X'
```

Run program in Python
```
	python <filename>.py
